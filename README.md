## 75 Hard App with React and Tailwind CSS

This project is a React application designed to help users track their progress on the 75 Hard challenge. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:** Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
2. **Clone the repository:** Use `git clone https://github.com/your-username/75-hard-app.git` to clone this repository locally (replace `your-username` with your GitHub username).
3. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all required dependencies.

**Running the Development Server**

1. Start the development server using `npm start` or `yarn start`. This will launch the app in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000/.
2. Changes made to the code will be reflected automatically in the browser thanks to React's hot module replacement (HMR).

**Project Structure**

The project is organized with the following directory structure:

* `src`: Contains the application source code.
    * `components`: Reusable UI components for the app (ChallengeList, DailyTracker, etc.).
    * `styles`: Tailwind CSS configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) and custom CSS styles.
    * `App.js`: The main entry point for the React application.
* `public`: Stores static assets like fonts or images.

**Key Features**

* **Challenge List:** Displays the list of the 75 Hard challenges with checkboxes to mark completion.
* **Daily Task Tracking:** Tracks daily tasks like water intake, reading, and workouts using forms, progress bars, or buttons.
* **Progress Dashboard:** Visualizes user progress metrics like completed days, streak count, and charts.
* **Optional Features:**
    * Habit Tracker: Allows users to track additional habits they want to build or break during the program.
    * User Profile: Enables users to manage their profile information and preferences.


**Using Tailwind CSS**

Tailwind CSS provides utility classes for styling your components. Refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation ([https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)) for detailed configuration and usage instructions.

**Further Customization**

This project provides a solid foundation. Feel free to customize it further by:

* Adding new features based on your needs.
* Tailoring the UI design using Tailwind CSS classes.
* Implementing user authentication for data persistence across devices (optional).

**Deployment**

Once you're satisfied with your app, you can deploy it to a production server using services like Netlify or Vercel.
